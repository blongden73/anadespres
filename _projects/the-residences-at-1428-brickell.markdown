The concept for The Residences at 1428 Brickell was developed based on research gathered from more than 250 luxury residential and hotel properties globally and interviews with three dozen renowned architects and designers. As a result, the property was crafted with the owner’s experience and privacy at the forefront of every decision, making The Residences at 1428 Brickell not only beautiful to behold but ideal to live in. The Residences are the World’s First Solar-Powered Residential Skyscraper Planned In Brickell.

Best-in-class architects, designers, engineers, fabricators, technologists, artisans, and artists were hand selected and have poured heart and soul into the project, developing new ideas, challenging accepted standards, and creating innovative solutions unlike anything the city of Miami has ever seen.
