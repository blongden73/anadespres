# Art Director, Visual UXUI Designer, Experience Creator, Digital Specialist, and Art Observer focused on Real Estate, Architecture, and Luxury brands. 

Art Director, Visual and UXUI Designer for High-end brands. 12+ Years experience in Design for the Real Estate industry for Europe and LATAM markets. From 2013 to 2015 I worked as the Head of the Digital Department of Conway + Partners International Branding Agency for the US Real State market. Since 2016 to date I am a Digital Creative Associate in Twentyfive™.

I am currently working for my own Design firm for Real Estate and Fashion Industries for New York, Barcelona, Paris, Mexico, and Buenos Aires clients.

I am, also a co-founder in Puente Studio™ a conscious Design Studio for Leisure, Well-being, Fashion, and Art run by women for women based in London and Buenos Aires.

I try to learn something from each experience to create new ones, waiting for the small changes and improvements to design a happier place to live, discover, enjoy, love, and be.
